sample code in python

reate an empty dictionary for the input data; the student's name is used as a key, while all the associated scores are stored in a tuple
 enter an "infinite" loop( reeason being i want to be stuck in the loop: use your imagination lol)
 if the name is an empty string 
 ask for one of the student's scores (an integer from the range 0-10) and if the score entered is not within the range from 0 to 10, leave the loop
  if this is a new student, unknown to the dictionary, create a new entry
  it then iterate through the tuple, taking all the subsequent scores and updating the sum, together with the counter, valuate and print the student's name and average score.
